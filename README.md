IQT (Insane Queue & Task) is a robust, high-performance, and incredibly reliable queuing and task management system designed to handle asynchronous operations and background processes with unmatched efficiency. Part of the "Insane" suite of tools (alongside IVR and IAR), IQT empowers developers to build highly scalable and responsive applications by offloading heavy computational tasks, ensuring seamless execution even under extreme load.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Insane Performance:** Engineered for lightning-fast task processing, IQT ensures your background jobs are executed with minimal latency, keeping your applications responsive and efficient.
*   **Rock-Solid Reliability:** With advanced retry mechanisms, robust error handling, and persistent queueing options, IQT guarantees task completion, even in the face of system failures or temporary outages.
*   **Effortless Scalability:** Designed from the ground up to scale horizontally, IQT can effortlessly manage millions of tasks across distributed environments, adapting to your application's growing demands.
*   **Flexible Task Management:** Supports diverse task types, complex scheduling, and customizable prioritization, giving you granular control over your workflow.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Built with a developer-friendly API, IQT integrates smoothly into existing projects, allowing you to quickly define, enqueue, and process tasks.
*   **Decoupled Architecture:** Promotes a modular and maintainable codebase by decoupling producers from consumers, enhancing system resilience and flexibility.

## üöÄ Why Choose IQT?

In today's fast-paced digital world, applications need to be agile, responsive, and resilient. IQT provides the backbone for such systems by:

*   **Improving User Experience:** Offload long-running operations (like image processing, email sending, data analysis) to background tasks, keeping your user interface snappy and interactive.
*   **Enhancing System Resilience:** Ensure critical processes are completed reliably, even if parts of your system temporarily go offline.
*   **Optimizing Resource Usage:** Efficiently distribute workloads across your infrastructure, preventing bottlenecks and maximizing throughput.
*   **Simplifying Complex Workflows:** Break down large, monolithic tasks into smaller, manageable units that can be processed asynchronously.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Conceptual)

While implementation details would vary based on the specific technology stack (e.g., programming language, database, message broker), the general workflow with IQT would involve:

1.  **Defining Tasks:** Create clear, self-contained units of work.
2.  **Enqueuing Tasks:** Send tasks to the IQT queue from your application's main thread.
3.  **Processing Tasks:** Have dedicated workers or consumers pick up tasks from the queue and execute them asynchronously.
4.  **Monitoring (Optional):** Keep an eye on queue depth, task status, and worker performance.

```java
// Conceptual example (not functional code, illustrating the idea)

// 1. Define a Task Interface or Base Class
public interface IQTTask {
    void execute();
    String getTaskId(); // For tracking purposes
}

// 2. Implement Specific Tasks
public class ProcessImageTask implements IQTTask {
    private String imageUrl;
    private String filterType;
    private String taskId; // Unique ID for this task instance

    public ProcessImageTask(String imageUrl, String filterType) {
        this.imageUrl = imageUrl;
        this.filterType = filterType;
        this.taskId = "IMG_" + System.currentTimeMillis(); // Simple ID generation
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Processing image: " + imageUrl + " with filter: " + filterType);
        // Simulate image processing
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        System.out.println("Finished processing image: " + imageUrl);
    }

    @Override
    public String getTaskId() {
        return taskId;
    }
}

// 3. Enqueue Tasks (from your application's main logic)
public class ApplicationMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Assume IQT is initialized and running
        // IQT.getQueue().enqueue(new ProcessImageTask("example.com/pic1.jpg", "grayscale"));
        // IQT.getQueue().enqueue(new ProcessImageTask("example.com/pic2.jpg", "sepia"));
        System.out.println("Tasks enqueued for IQT processing.");
    }
}

// 4. Task Worker (a separate process or thread that consumes tasks)
public class IQTWorker {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("IQT Worker started, waiting for tasks...");
        // This loop would typically run indefinitely
        // while (true) {
        //     IQTTask task = IQT.getQueue().dequeue(); // Get next task
        //     if (task != null) {
        //         System.out.println("Worker executing task: " + task.getTaskId());
        //         task.execute(); // Execute the task
        //     } else {
        //         try {
        //             Thread.sleep(1000); // Wait if no tasks
        //         } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        //             Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        //             break;
        //         }
        //     }
        // }
    }
}
