# IQT: Insane Queue & Task

![IQT Logo - Insane Queue & Task](https://insaneframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LogoIQT-300x140.png)

IQT (Insane Queue & Task) is a robust, high-performance, and incredibly reliable queuing and task management system designed to handle asynchronous operations and background processes with unmatched efficiency. Part of the "Insane" suite of tools ( alongside IVR and IAR), IQT empowers developers to build highly scalable and responsive applications by offloading heavy computational tasks, ensuring seamless execution even under extreme load.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Insane Performance:** Engineered for lightning-fast task processing, IQT ensures your background jobs are executed with minimal latency, keeping your applications responsive and efficient.
*   **Rock-Solid Reliability:** With advanced retry mechanisms, robust error handling, and persistent queueing options, IQT guarantees task completion, even in the face of system failures or temporary outages.
*   **Effortless Scalability:** Designed from the ground up to scale horizontally, IQT can effortlessly manage millions of tasks across distributed environments, adapting to your application's growing demands.
*   **Flexible Task Management:** Supports diverse task types, complex scheduling, and customizable prioritization, giving you granular control over your workflow.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Built with a developer-friendly API, IQT integrates smoothly into existing projects, allowing you to quickly define, enqueue, and process tasks.
*   **Decoupled Architecture:** Promotes a modular and maintainable codebase by decoupling producers from consumers, enhancing system resilience and flexibility.

## üöÄ Why Choose IQT?

In today's fast-paced digital world, applications need to be agile, responsive, and resilient. IQT provides the backbone for such systems by:

*   **Improving User Experience:** Offload long-running operations (like image processing, email sending, data analysis) to background tasks, keeping your user interface snappy and interactive.
*   **Enhancing System Resilience:** Ensure critical processes are completed reliably, even if parts of your system temporarily go offline.
*   **Optimizing Resource Usage:** Efficiently distribute workloads across your infrastructure, preventing bottlenecks and maximizing throughput.
*   **Simplifying Complex Workflows:** Break down large, monolithic tasks into smaller, manageable units that can be processed asynchronously.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Conceptual with Unreal Engine C++)

For Unreal Engine developers, IQT would integrate seamlessly into your C++ projects, allowing you to offload heavy computations or long-running tasks to background queues, preventing hitches on your game thread.

The example below demonstrates how you would define task data and enqueue it using IQT's `UIQT_Queue` component. It also illustrates a concept of how a "worker" would consume these tasks.

**Conceptual Structure:**

1.  **`UIQTImageProcessTaskData` (Task Data):** A simple UCLASS to encapsulate the specific parameters for your task (in this case, image processing).
2.  **`AIQTManagerActor` (Queue Manager Actor):** A persistent actor in your level that would host the `UIQT_Queue` component instance.
3.  **`UMyIQTSubsystem` (Management Subsystem):** A `UGameInstanceSubsystem` that acts as a global access point to find and interact with the `UIQT_Queue` from the `AIQTManagerActor`. It orchestrates task enqueuing.
4.  **`AMyGameActor` (Task Producer):** An example actor that initiates a task, sending its data to the `UMyIQTSubsystem`.
5.  **`UMyIQTWorkerComponent` (Consumer/Worker Component):** A conceptual component that, in a loop or by event, dequeues tasks from the `UIQT_Queue` and processes them in a separate thread.
